# IPAI_script 
This is the R script created for analyzing the relationship between a couple of the scales in the t-release perceptual survey. Note that these analyeses don't directly focus on the linguistic variable, but consider the relationship between some of the attributes within the context of the talker for this study (a younger, college educated woman).
