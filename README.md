# IPAI_script 
This is an R script created for analyzing the relationship between a few of the scales in the t-release perceptual survey data. Results were shared among both linguists and those workign in the education design space. A link to these materials will be added soon.
See the WECOL script for how these same data were analyzed with a greater attention to the linguistic variable.
